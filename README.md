#Installing dependencies and running the application
First of all you must have ***node*** and ***CouchDB*** installed into your machine, then move into your project folder and run the following commands:
```console
npm install     // to install dependencies
```
and then:
```console
npm start     // to run the server
```
After doing that, open your browser and go to ***http://localhost:3000/***.
If you want to manage your database in CouchDB go to ***http://localhost:5984/_utils***.
